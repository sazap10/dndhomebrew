					"Feral vampiric illithids are the result of hideous experimentation upon a select few mind flayers from the domain of Bluetspur. The curse of vampirism, which can heighten charm and cunning within its humanoid victims, is devastating to the illithid mind. Its alien mind succumbs to the worst aspects of vampirism, turning it into little more than a feral beast. Even its telepathic abilities degrade to their basest form, transmitting little more than emotions of hunger and fear to all creatures within 120 feet. This telepathic sensation of insatiable hunger can serve as a warning to the feral vampiric illithid's prey, but it's also a potent weapon of fear, causing its prey to panic and act rashly.",
					"A feral vampiric illithid stalks its prey, using its Spider Climb trait to hide in the darkened ceilings of caves or castles, then scuttling down and pouncing on distracted foes. Though the process of transforming a mind flayer into a vampire degrades it psionic abilities to the point where it can no longer cast spells, it retains its potent Mind Blast, which it uses to stun creatures before wreathing its prey's head with tentacles and devouring their brain. ",
					"Though its skin has been hardened by the curse of vampirism, a feral vampiric illithid's body is still frail and wiry. As such,  prefers to attack single solitary creatures, or pick off stragglers at the back of a group, or ambush a group of creatures that are otherwise distracted by combat. After striking, the vampiric illithid flees, using its Regeneration trait to regain its strength before attacking again. "
